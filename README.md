### Where i got some stuff

I got the rofi theme from [here](https://github.com/undiabler/nord-rofi-theme)

The color scheme from alacritty I found from somewhere I don't remember, just google for alacritty nord color scheme.

I downloaded a bunch of wallpapers from [here](https://github.com/linuxdotexe/nordic-wallpapers) too.

### My apps
1. Terminal:  
I use alacritty(some times i change to st) as my main terminal and in my laptop I use sakura.
2. Text editor / IDE:
Neovim with NvChad is my main text editor, but sometimes I prefer to use VSCode for practicity.
3. Browser:
I only use firefox and brave.
4. WM:
Qtile, but I'll make an awesomewm setup for my laptop.
5. OS:
ArchLabs for my desktop and Debian for my laptop.
6. Extras:
I use barrier too, so I can use the same mouse and keyboard on both computers. 
##### *That is the end probably*
